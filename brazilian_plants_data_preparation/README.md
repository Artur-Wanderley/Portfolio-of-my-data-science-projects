# Data preparation to model plant species distribution in the Brazilian Caatinga dry forest in response to climate change and other human disturbances¶
This project is part of an academic research in which I am collaborating. The research involves [Dr. Bruno Pinho](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bruno_Pinho3), [Professor Marcelo Tabarelli](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcelo_Tabarelli) (both from the Federal University of Pernambuco - Brazil) and [Professor Carlos Peres](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Peres), from the University of East Anglia - United Kingdom.

The goal of this academic research is to understand the extent to which plant species from the Brazilian Caatinga dry forest are threatened by climate change and human activities. To reach this goal, we will build a predictive model to predict which flora (in terms of species number and composition) we can expect in the near future, given specific climate and human disturbance conditions.

In this project, we will perform some data manipulation to convert the raw data we have into a dataset appropriate to build a predictive model. 

## This project is divided in four parts:

### - Part I: Grouping geographic occurrences of plant species into grid cells
### - Part II: Converting the dataset into a matrix of species abundance
### - Part III: Data cleaning and string manipulation¶
### - Part IV: Plotting the data
 

## Note:

We will make the dataset used in this project publically available upon the publication of the full research in a scientific journal.
