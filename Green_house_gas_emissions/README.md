# The top 20 greenhouse gas-emitting countries over time

In this project, our goal is to explore World Bank data on greenhouse gas emissions to find out which countries have contributed the most for global warming from 1960 to 2012.

To reach this goal, we'll need to do data cleaning and data visualization.

Along the way of cleaning and visualizing data, we will:

- Use several functions of the pandas and NumPy libraries to clean and manipulate data
- Create a function to nicely visualize missing data using a heatmap
- Web scraping
- Use applymap and lambda function to transform data
- Join datasets with pandas.DataFrame.merge()
- Use for loops to plot greenhouse emissions of multiple countries
