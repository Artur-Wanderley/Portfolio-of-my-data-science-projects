# Introduction
In this project, we will play the role of a data analyst working for an e-learning company that offers courses on coding. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our products and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement.

Project goal
Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product.

Data
To find out the two best markets to advertise in, we will use the freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey.

Because they run a popular Medium publication (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web and mobile development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis.

The survey data is publicly available in this GitHub repository.
