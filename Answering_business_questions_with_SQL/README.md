## In this project, we practice SQL skills by using a database of the Chinook record store.

Specifically, we will use SQLite to explore the Chinook database (downloaded here) and help managers make business decisions.

## The business questions we will answer in this project are the following:

### - What are the most popular music genres sold in the USA?
### - Who's the guy? Looking at sales agents performances
### - How good are sales by country?
### - What do customers prefer to buy, full albums or individuals tracks?

## Note

I developed this project as part of the "SQL intermediate: table relations and joins" course of Dataquest.
